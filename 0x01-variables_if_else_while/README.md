`ascii` (You do not need to learn about `scanf`, `getc`, `getchar`, `EOF`, `EXIT_SUCCESS`, `time`, `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX`, `for` loops, `do...while` loops, functions.)
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
What the the relational operators and how to use them
What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
What are the boolean operators and how to use them
How to use the `if, if ... else` statements
How to use comments
How to declare variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`
How to assign values to variables
How to print the values of variables of type `char`, `int`, `unsigned int` with `printf`
How to use the `while` loop
How to use variables with the `while` loop
How to print variables using `printf`
What is the `ASCII` character set
What are the purpose of the `gcc` flags `-m32` and `-m64`

## Requirements
General
Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
All your files should end with a new line
A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project
There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
You are not allowed to use `system`
Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
