## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
- How to use arguments passed to your program
- What are two prototypes of `main` that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
- How to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

## Requirements
General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`
- Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
- You are allowed to use the standard library
